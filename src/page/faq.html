<a class="h1" href="@SELF@">About & FAQ</a>

<p>
	I'll be writing more about <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/">postmarketOS</a> and related topics, such as <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> and maybe <a href="https://halium.org/">Halium</a> on this blog. But also about experiments with <a href="@WEBROOT@/page/donate/">crowdfunding</a> the whole thing to make it my next day job. Feel free to <a href="@WEBROOT@/pages/feedback/">write</a> me more questions.
</p>

<h2>Any plans to collaborate with <a href="https://halium.org/">Halium</a>?</h2>
<p>
	Yes, I hope we can share udev rules, unify kernels and maybe work on a few other parts together! But keep in mind, that postmarketOS has a different architecture (mostly due to Alpine Linux, which is required for <code>pmbootstrap</code>), so it can not build on the Halium stack and this will not be a goal in the future. It does not use the glibc, systemd or the Android build system, or run Android next to its Linux kernel, Musl libc and busybox userland.

<h2>Why did you wait so long before releasing anything?</h2>
<p>
	I needed to make sure, that <code>pmbootstrap</code> is safe to use. It downloads Alpine's <code>apk</code> (<a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management">Alpine Linux package manager</a>, not to be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package">Android app format</a>) binary from the Internet and executes it with root rights. This means, that <code>apk</code> needs to be verified properly before execution (GPG key signature check with <code>openssl</code>, minimum required version), and the whole verification process needed to have testcases (which it does now). Furthermore I took my time to put up this blog and write <a href="@WEBROOT@/post/postmarketOS/">the announcement</a>, as well as the rest of the content.
</p>
<p>
	Oh and I did actually release my <a href="https://github.com/ollieparanoid/aports-extra">Alpine cross-compiling efforts</a> about a month earlier.

<h2>Why do you keep talking about Musl/Linux all the time instead of GNU/Linux, why does Alpine use <a href="https://www.musl-libc.org/">musl</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox">BusyBox</a> instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library">glibc</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities">GNU Core Utilities</a>?</h2>

GNU/Linux implies that the system is based on the Linux kernel, and then uses GNU software (the GNU LibC, and the GNU coreutils) to put that kernel to some use. An astonishing part of the software in normal GNU/Linux distributions comes from the GNU project, and no "Linux distribution" would be usable without GNU. Except Alpine, and all the other distributions based on alternative libc libraries and userlands.
Indeed, Alpine has replaced a lot of GNU components (with the exception of GCC and the binutils, which are in the works). But they have also packaged just about every typical GNU userspace component, except for the glibc; so you can just install them if you want to (example: <code>apk add bash</code>). Having a different libc means that software compiled for GNU/Linux will not necessarily run on Alpine. Since there already is a heavy confusion between Linux and GNU/Linux, it appeared important to make that distinction clear: while you can install GNU software from Alpine packages on Alpine, you cannot take any binary linked against the GlibC (steam, skype, etc.) and simply have it work.

Besides that, calling postmarketOS a Musl/Linux distribution helps to differentiate it better:
<ul>
	<li> GNU/Linux (Linux kernel with a GNU userspace)
	<li> Android/Linux (Linux kernel with Android Bionic libc, and Android userspace)
	<li> Musl/Linux (Linux kernel with the Musl libc, useless without a userspace such as busybox)
	<li> Linux (just the kernel)
</ul>
